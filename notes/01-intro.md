What and why:

React is a jS library for building user interface

- we write jS, we build UI interface, highly interactive UIs

creating React project after downloading node:

npm create vite -> if using vite

> then npm install

npx create-react-app -> if using react create app


react and react dom are installed via package.json 
node uses package.json to manage dependencies 

.createRoot() -> takes a pointer to render it. 
.render() -> React method to run
